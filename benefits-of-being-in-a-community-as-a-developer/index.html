<p>forLoopCU was the first developers‚Äô meetup I attended. This was when my growth as a web developer actually started.</p>
<p>I started learning web development last year 2016 after I finished my first year at the university (Computer Science). I learnt the basics of web development using HTML, CSS and JavaScript during my SIWES at Plat Technologies. It was a pretty exciting time for me. At that time, I really loved web development but after SIWES I just left it and thought that I had I learnt everything I needed to build web applications for real use üòÖ. After SIWES was second year.</p>
<p><strong>‚ÄúGet excited about anything new thing you want to learn.‚Äù</strong></p>
<p>In Alpha Semester of my 200 Level, I could now say ‚ÄúI can build a website üòé‚Äù. I did not know much then what other technologies were available to build awesome web apps (I did not even know what WordPress was at that time üòï). So I just went on throughout the semester with the same HTML, CSS and JavaScript knowledge. Apart from the C++ and Python that we were taught in school that semester, I did not learn any new thing in web development.</p>
<p><strong>‚ÄúAlways try to learn new things or improve on your previous knowledge on something you have learnt.‚Äù</strong></p>
<p>Then in Omega Semester when the whole community thing started. At the beginning of the semester, I started seeing a lot of retweets about an event called ‚ÄúforLoopCU‚Äù. So I asked one of my course mates about it and she told me it was a meetup for developers. I decided I would attend it.</p>
<p>forLoopCU came. On that Saturday morning I woke up and prepared for the meetup though I did not know what to take along but I took my PC since it was for developers. That day a lot of great developers came for the meetup. The likes of <a href="https://medium.com/@unicodeveloper">Prosper Otemuyiwa</a> (the fireman), <a href="https://medium.com/@imogiemubarak">AM Imogie</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@timigod">Timi Ajiboye</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@AceKYD">Adewale Abati</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@ireade">Ire Aderinokun</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@codebeast_">Christian Nwamba</a>, many others.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You‚Äôll never know what you‚Äôre missing when you don‚Äôt attend meetups like these</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Timi Ajiboye took the session of back-end in web development where he took us through a short tutorial of building a clone of twitter using ruby on rails. To be honest I was just lost throughout in that session cause I did not know what a framework was at that time.</p>
<p>AM Imogie took the design session and Ire Aderinokun took the front-end session.</p>
<p>That day was a very exciting day for everyone that was there. I learned a lot of things that day about being and participating in a community of developers.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;People will take you to where code cannot&rdquo; - Prosper Otemuyiwa</strong></p>
<p>The above quote is the summary of what I took away from that event aside from the lovely stickers I got.</p>
<p><img src="/images/community-dev-benefits/laptop-with-stickers.png" alt=""></p>
<p>After forLoopCU, there were a number of other meetups I attended that has really got me excited about the progress in the community in Nigeria.</p>
<p><strong>The benefits&hellip;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You get to know what‚Äôs new around you.</li>
<li>You get to learn new things faster.</li>
<li>You get all the help you need.</li>
<li>You get to know what you did not know.</li>
<li>You learn to humble yourself more and learn from those that are ahead of you.</li>
<li>You learn to be more competitive in your field which will push you to learn faster.</li>
<li>You learn to appreciate people more and understand that a developer has a lot of contribution to humanity.</li>
</ul>
<p>And finally, you‚Äôll learn to keep pushing to become a world-class developer as Prosper Otemuyiwa would say &ldquo;Be a world-class developer&rdquo;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Remember</strong>: And don‚Äôt miss any meetup you have an opportunity to attend.</p>
