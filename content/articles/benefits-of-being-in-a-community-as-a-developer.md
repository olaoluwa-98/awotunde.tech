forLoopCU was the first developers’ meetup I attended. This was when my growth as a web developer actually started.

I started learning web development last year 2016 after I finished my first year at the university (Computer Science). I learnt the basics of web development using HTML, CSS and JavaScript during my SIWES at Plat Technologies. It was a pretty exciting time for me. At that time, I really loved web development but after SIWES I just left it and thought that I had I learnt everything I needed to build web applications for real use 😅. After SIWES was second year.

**“Get excited about anything new thing you want to learn.”**

In Alpha Semester of my 200 Level, I could now say “I can build a website 😎”. I did not know much then what other technologies were available to build awesome web apps (I did not even know what WordPress was at that time 😕). So I just went on throughout the semester with the same HTML, CSS and JavaScript knowledge. Apart from the C++ and Python that we were taught in school that semester, I did not learn any new thing in web development.

**“Always try to learn new things or improve on your previous knowledge on something you have learnt.”**

Then in Omega Semester when the whole community thing started. At the beginning of the semester, I started seeing a lot of retweets about an event called “forLoopCU”. So I asked one of my course mates about it and she told me it was a meetup for developers. I decided I would attend it.

forLoopCU came. On that Saturday morning I woke up and prepared for the meetup though I did not know what to take along but I took my PC since it was for developers. That day a lot of great developers came for the meetup. The likes of [Prosper Otemuyiwa](https://medium.com/@unicodeveloper) (the fireman), [AM Imogie](https://medium.com/@imogiemubarak), [Timi Ajiboye](https://medium.com/@timigod), [Adewale Abati](https://medium.com/@AceKYD), [Ire Aderinokun](https://medium.com/@ireade), [Christian Nwamba](https://medium.com/@codebeast_), many others.

Timi Ajiboye took the session of back-end in web development where he took us through a short tutorial of building a clone of twitter using ruby on rails. To be honest I was just lost throughout in that session cause I did not know what a framework was at that time.

AM Imogie took the design session and Ire Aderinokun took the front-end session.

That day was a very exciting day for everyone that was there. I learned a lot of things that day about being and participating in a community of developers.

**"People will take you to where code cannot" - Prosper Otemuyiwa**

The above quote is the summary of what I took away from that event aside from the lovely stickers I got.

After forLoopCU, there were a number of other meetups I attended that has really got me excited about the progress in the community in Nigeria.

**The benefits...**

* You get to know what’s new around you.
* You get to learn new things faster.
* You get all the help you need.
* You get to know what you did not know.
* You learn to humble yourself more and learn from those that are ahead of you.
* You learn to be more competitive in your field which will push you to learn faster.
* You learn to appreciate people more and understand that a developer has a lot of contribution to humanity.

And finally, you’ll learn to keep pushing to become a world-class developer as Prosper Otemuyiwa would say "Be a world-class developer".

> **Remember**: And don’t miss any meetup you have an opportunity to attend.
