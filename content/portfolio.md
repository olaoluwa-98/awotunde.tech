I have over 4 years experience building for the web. I'm currently focused on backend infrastructures. I currently use **Java** and **Node.js**.

Some projects I worked on include:

- [Adyen](https://adyen.com) - A global payment processor & bank. I currently work here as a Java Engineer on the team building and maintaining the [Payouts service](https://www.adyen.com/payouts).
- [Pleo](https://pleo.io) - A business spending solution. I worked on the backend of the [Partner Portal](https://www.pleo.io/en/partnerships).
- [Jetseed](https://jetseed.com) - An app for sending money, making payment and saving securely. I worked on upgrading the backend infrastructure for the company's re-brand (it was formerly Pettysave). Read more about the re-brand in this [article](https://blog.jetseed.com/pettysave-is-now-jetseed-2918ea2c3c76).
- [Tamborin](https://tamborin.io) - A platform that offers local and international tech jobs, simplifies and handles all the processes of applying for a job. I worked on the backend API & infrastructure.
- [Pettysave](https://pettysave.com) - A fintech platform for savings & investments. I built the backend infrastructure. I wrote an [article about it](/my-experience-with-rebuilding-a-product-from-ground-up).
- [Code Chauffeur](https://codechauffeur.com) : this website ðŸ‘€.
- [Fixus](https://fixus.com.ng) - A platform for ordering gadget repair online. Pick up before repair, delivery after repair. I built the entire platform and managed it for about 3 years.
- **Physique** - A mobile application that classifies physical activities such as walking, running, jogging etc. using accelerometer readings and records it daily. This was my computer science degree final year project. Unfortunately, I didn't complete the project but I learnt a number of things about deep learning.

Asides from these projects, I also contribute to open source projects in my free time. You can check my Github profile, [@olaoluwa-98](https://github.com/olaoluwa-98).
