I have 3 years+ experience building for the web. I'm currently focused on backend and infrastructure. I currently use **Node.js (TS & JS)** and **Python** for most of my development.

These are some of the projects I have worked on:

- [Tamborin](https://tamborin.io) - A website that offers local and international tech jobs, simplifies and handles all the processes of applying for a job
- [Pettysave](https://pettysave.com) - Built and currently manage the backend infrastructure. I wrote an [article about it](/my-experience-with-rebuilding-a-product-from-ground-up).
- [Code Chauffeur](https://codechauffeur.com) : this website ðŸ‘€
- [Fixus](https://fixus.com.ng) - A website for ordering gadget repair online. Pick up before repair, delivery after repair. I built the entire website and currently manage it.
- **Physique** - A mobile application that classifies physical activities such as walking, running, jogging etc. using accelerometer readings and records it daily. This was my computer science degree final year project. Unfortunately, I didn't complete the project but I learnt a number of things about deep learning

Asides from these projects, I also contribute to open source projects in my free time. You can check my Github profile, [@olaoluwa-98](https://github.com/olaoluwa-98).
