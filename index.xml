I&amp;rsquo;m currently focused on backend infrastructures. I currently use Node.js (TS &amp;amp; JS) and Kotlin for most of my development.
These are some of the projects I have worked on:
Pleo - I&amp;rsquo;m currently working as a full-time software engineer here. Jetseed - An app for sending money, making payment and saving securely.

In my first few weeks, I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like I was in a tech company. The business product was initially built by an outsourcing agency. In my opinion, they didn&amp;rsquo;t do a good job with the product. Of course, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t present during the process of developing the product so I did not know how they got there. One thing was sure, the product was very problematic and needed an upgrade.</description></item><item><title>A Simple Road Map to Learn New Frameworks</title><link>https://codechauffeur.com/a-simple-road-map-to-learn-new-frameworks/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jul 2020 01:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://codechauffeur.com/a-simple-road-map-to-learn-new-frameworks/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s 2020, there are lots of things to learn as a software developer. Your ability to learn fast sets you apart.
One of the best things about modern software development is the availability of free tools and frameworks. For example, as a frontend developer there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of frontend frameworks you can use: React, Vue, Angular, Emberjs, Backbonejs, and many more. This could be challenging because you have to select what to use.</description></item><item><title>Easy Deployment Setup With Bitbucket and AWS ECS</title><link>https://codechauffeur.com/easy-deployment-setup-with-bitbucket-and-aws-ecs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jul 2020 18:58:41 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://codechauffeur.com/easy-deployment-setup-with-bitbucket-and-aws-ecs/</guid><description>Deployment is one of the most important parts of product development and launch.

An app’s config is everything that is likely to vary between deploys (staging, production, developer environments, etc). Most applications that require persistent storage use databases. Applications connect to databases using certain parameters and credentials which are usually stored in a type of Config. The database config usually includes a database driver, port, name, username and password.
You must have seen one/more of these env variables in projects:</description></item><item><title>Convert String Case Easily in VS Code with this Extension</title><link>https://codechauffeur.com/convert-string-case-easily-in-vs-code-with-this-extension/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 May 2020 18:07:44 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://codechauffeur.com/convert-string-case-easily-in-vs-code-with-this-extension/</guid><description>As developers, we all want to develop things fast.

Most times when something goes wrong it would take a while to get to the root of the problem because the error message may not be descriptive enough or there&amp;rsquo;s a variable that you expect to have a value but it&amp;rsquo;s null or undefined.
The first thing that comes to mind when debugging in Node.js is usually to use console.log. This usually will get you a solution but in the long run, it wastes time.</description></item><item><title>How to Add Custom Validation Rules to Adonis Validator</title><link>https://codechauffeur.com/how-to-add-custom-validation-rules-to-adonis-validator/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Apr 2020 07:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://codechauffeur.com/how-to-add-custom-validation-rules-to-adonis-validator/</guid><description>If you are reading this article, I assume you must have used AdonisJs or you must have heard about the framework.
