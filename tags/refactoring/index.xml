In my first few weeks, I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like I was in a tech company. The business product was initially built by an outsourcing agency. In my opinion, they didn&amp;rsquo;t do a good job with the product. Of course, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t present during the process of developing the product so I did not know how they got there. One thing was sure, the product was very problematic and needed an upgrade.</description></item></channel></rss>
